# LocalStack Lambda with Docker Deployment

This project showcases the deployment of a **Python Lambda function using Docker and LocalStack**, providing a local simulation of AWS services. It aims to demonstrate the capabilities of LocalStack in a development environment and how Docker can be used to containerize Lambda functions for AWS.

## Technologies Used

- **LocalStack**: Emulates AWS services locally.
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless computing service.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform.
- **Python**: Programming language for Lambda function.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install LocalStack** to emulate AWS services locally.
2. **Build the Docker image** using the provided `Dockerfile`.
3. **Deploy the Lambda function** using LocalStack commands.
4. **Invoke the Lambda function** to test its execution locally.

## Challenges and Solutions

- Encountered issues with Lambda invocation output, solved by checking LocalStack logs for correct execution and output handling.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical experience with AWS Lambda, Docker, and LocalStack.
- Learned to debug and solve deployment issues in a simulated cloud environment.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the project to include more AWS services.
- Enhance the Lambda function for more complex scenarios.

This project demonstrates practical cloud computing skills, problem-solving, and the ability to leverage modern development tools and services.
